# flac-m3u
A repository for creating my own flac m3u playlists for albums in The Inernet Archive. The current m3u files listed on the Internet Archive use their mp3 files. 


Notes:
- This approach is not elegant. I am just playing around to see if this is usable in anyway. If you have suggestions on how to make this better, please let me know!

- Tested with my Raspberry Pi 3 running Volumio3. The URL to the raw file content plays as a custom web radio channel in the Web Radio section of Volumio. 

- File names do not match song titles. 

- You can skip forward in tracks with no problem, however trying to go back a track brings you to the beginning of song 1.

- Hitting pause seems to crash the player's play/pause functionality. After hitting pause once, you can press play again and it will restart playing but your play buttons become unresponsive after that.
